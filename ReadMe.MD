### Why KMS?

To provide a secure, fully managed key management service that facilitates easy encryption key creation, rotation, and integration with various AWS services to enhance data security and compliance.

### Encryption Key Types

1. Symmetric

   - Plain Text File  + KEY-1    ---->   Encrypted File + KEY-1 ---->  Plain Text File

   - The same key used for both encryption and decryption.

2. Asymmetric

   - Plain Text File  + Public-KEY    ---->   Encrypted File + Private-KEY   ---->  Plain Text File

   - Public key is used for encryption and private key is used for decryption.
